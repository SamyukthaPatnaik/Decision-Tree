# Decision-Tree
- Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. 
- Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- It is a tree-structured classifier, the tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
